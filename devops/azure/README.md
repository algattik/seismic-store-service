1. R3MVP - OSDU
```
AGENT_POOL: Name of the build agent pool to be used.
SERVICE_CONNECTION_NAME: Azure Resource service connection (could be for any environment, is just a place holder).
```

Please replace ${{ provider }} with one of next values: Azure, GCP
```
e2eAdminEmail: Email account with admin permissions used by end to end test.
e2eDataPartition: DataPartition to be used by end to end test.
e2eIdToken: First token to be used by end to end test.
e2eIdToken: Second token to be used by end to end test.
e2eLegaltag01: First legaltag to be used by end to end test.
e2eLegaltag01: Second legaltag to be used by end to end test.
e2eNewUser: User email to test add a new user.
e2eProjectId: Project id of project to be used by end to end test.
e2eServiceId: First service id of service to be used by end to end test.

e2eTargetProjId: Target project id of project to be used by end to end test.
e2eTargetServiceId: Target service id of service to be used by end to end test.
e2eTenant: Tenant name to be used by end to end test.
PORT: Port where seistore-svc is going to listen (only used when flux enabled).
REPLICA_COUNT: Number of pod replicas (only used when flux enabled).  
serviceUrlSuffix: Url suffix where seistore-svc is listening, usually: seistore-svc/api/v3
utest.runtime.image: Name of container image, usually: seistore-svc-runtime
```
3. R3MVP - ${{ provider }} Target Env - ${{ environment }}
Please replace ${{ provider }} with one of next values: Azure, GCP
Please replace ${{ environment }} with name of environment. Please see Notes section.
```
cluster_name: Kubernetes cluster name (Used when flux is not enabled and GCP).
cluster_zone: Kubernetes cluster zone (Used when flux is not enabled and GCP).
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME: Private container registry name. When using GCP is gcr.io.
container_registry_path: To provide subfolder in container registry.
DNS_HOST: Host/DNS name where entitlements service is.
ENVIRONMENT_NAME: Name of environment.
gcp_project: Provide gcp project name where kubernetes cluster is.
KEYVAULT_NAME: Azure keyvault name.
PROVIDER_NAME: Use one of next values: Azure, GCP
REDIS_HOST: Redis host name.
REDIS_PORT: Redis port.
secure_file_container_registry: Name of secure file for container registry connection (used only on GCP).
SERVICE_CONNECTION_NAME: Azure service connection with permissions to deploy to container registry (only used when provider is Azure).
```
## Secret files

1. GCP
```
secure_file_container_registry Secure file with connections to connect to container registry.
```

## Changes needed

1. Open devops/azure/pipeline.yml
2. Under build stage, add the providers. Example with both supported providers:
```
  - template: template/build-stage.yml
    parameters:
      serviceName: ${{ variables.serviceName }}
      providers:
	    -  name: GCP
		-  name: Azure
```
3. If flux is enabled in your cluster, in devops/azure/pipeline.yml add your repo and name it FluxRepo, then, in devops/azure/template/task/aks-deployment-steps.yml uncomment
```
    # - checkout: FluxRepo
      # persistCredentials: true
```
4. Under deploy stage, add the providers and environments. Example with 2 different providers:
```
  - template: template/deploy-stage.yml
    parameters:
      serviceName: ${{ variables.serviceName }}
      chartPath: ${{ variables.chartPath }}
      manifestRepo: ${{ variables.MANIFEST_REPO }}
      providers:
        -  name: GCP
           environments:
             - name: 'evt'
               fluxEnabled: false
               secureFile: evt-seistore-services.json
	    -  name: Azure
           environments: 
             - name: 'dev'
               fluxEnabled: true
             - name: 'qa'
               fluxEnabled: true
```

## Use pipeline

In pipelines create a new one and reference the pipeline to use devops/azure/pipeline.yml

## Notes

1. End to end (e2e) testing only happens in environments named: dev, qa, evd, and evt.
